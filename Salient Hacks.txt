On the portfolio page, I’m attempting to show some additional information down near the work-meta and nectar love wrap area, but I can never get it to display.

For instance, I dropped the following into template-portfolio.php but it doesn’t show:

<div class="covermonk-view-wrap">
  <a href="#">TEST</a>
</div><!--/covermonk-view-wrap-->
Can you point me in the right direction?

Hey,

You’d need to add that into the shortcode-processing.php file located in the nectar/tinyme directory as well – the portfolio template you added won’t be used with the page builder element/shortcode

Perfect. Thank you. Is this something that can be added to a child theme, because I would assume that on any future updates, the shortcode-processing.php would be overwritten.

Again thanks for the best Wordpress Theme and your good support!

Im looking for a way to remove portfolio slug for SEO reasons:

- is now: example.com/portfolio/ postname /

- should be: example.com/ postname /

Its not about changing the slug, found that in the settings.

What I found is this post with recommendation a plugin named “Custom Post Type Permalinks”, but is only allowes to change the part after the /portfolio/”changeable”

https://wordpress.org/support/topic/remove-portfolio-url
So is it possibile to completely remove the ”/portfolio” from the url with Salient?

Thank you for your help! Best, Lars

Ok, seems to be yesterday was a to long day for me…

The solution is pretty easy for Salient (v5.5.53):

salient/functions.php – edit function portfolio_register() around line NO. 1964:

set: ‘rewrite’ => array(‘slug’ => $custom_slug,’with_front’ => false),

to: ‘rewrite’ => false,

Save, open WP-> Settings -> Permalinks -> Save, Open your portfolio items and save them again. The right url should be changed now.

Seems to be working. Did I missed some important setting?

Best, Lars

Right after I posted this it stopped working, maybe due some browser caching. Could you please verfiy that this is the right way to remove the /Portfolio form the URL?

Contact Form 7 - text field background

Hi there,

Reference page: http://motioncue.com/contact-us/

[1] I’m trying to change the background color of the text field in my contact form. I’ve gone through previous comments, but it has only helped to change the bg color when the text fields are active, if not they remain grey.

[2] Also is there a way to change the bg color of the dropdown menu on the same page. Right now, it’s white, and not sure how that can be changed.

Thank you.

Hey,

1. Add this into the custom css box in the Salient options panel:
body .container-wrap input[type="text"], body .container-wrap textarea, .container-wrap input[type="email"], .container-wrap input[type="password"], .container-wrap input[type="tel"], .container-wrap input[type="url"], .container-wrap input[type="search"], .container-wrap input[type="date"] {
  background-color: #fff!important;
}
2.

select {
   background-color: #000!important;
} 
Cheers

Hey – the masonry titles are at a fixed size that css would be needed to alter. Add this into the custom css box in the Salient options panel:

body .masonry-blog-item h2.title {
  font-size: 37px !important;
  line-height: 40px !important;
}
